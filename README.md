# Below are the steps to run and see how our AI model hub, Bridge.ai, works.

In order to get started with the project you need to first clone the github repo
```
git clone https://github.com/kofiennin-t/hack-
```

Next up is navigaing your way throught the folders to successfully run a frontend with the a user interface for your interactions
```
cd front-end
```
You need to install the neccessary libraries to get started

before that make sure you have node installed by checking
```
node -v
```
if not availble use outside resource to reach this pre requisite point

inside front-end we need to run 
```
npm install 
```
this would install all needed libraries

Finally you can run the frontend with
```
npm run dev
```

you would need to go through the code base to include api keys and access keys
for quick tests
Hugging face token would work at any place with hf_..... just replace it with that
